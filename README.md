# ChatBot
### [DEPRECATED] due to WeatherBot being rewritten in Kotlin using PircBotX and Forecast.IO due to Yahoo! closing their weather API. This should still work and be relatively extendable if you're brave. I'd honestly reccommend looking elsewhere though. There exist several bugs in the external SmartIRC4Net project related with SSL connections that crop up at seemingly random times. It's also not especially stable in mono.
This is the 'core' bit of ChatBot. 
All it does by itself is join channels and idle, but it exposes an interface called 'IChatBotResponder' that you can implement to get it to respond to certain stimuli. There's also an IChatBotConfig interface that you can implement to get configuration from the user or a file or whatever you want really. It uses Meebey.SmartIrc4Net on the backend. Comments are a bit spartan, sorry about that. I wrote this for my personal amusement and evidently I have a thing for intentionally confusing myself.
